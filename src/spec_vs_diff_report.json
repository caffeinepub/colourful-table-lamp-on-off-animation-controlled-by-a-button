  "summary": "Frontend implements a single-page React UI with an SVG colorful lamp, a toggle button, English labels, and smooth on/off glow/light-cone transitions. However, the diff also introduces backend/auth-related code (Motoko actor + Internet Identity + actor/query hooks) which was explicitly a non-goal and not required for the lamp animation feature.",

    {
      "description": "Added backend canister (Motoko) stub even though backend changes were not required for this feature.",
      "reason": "BuildRequest explicitly says backend changes are not required; the diff adds a backend file.",

    {
      "description": "Introduced Internet Identity/authentication and actor/query infrastructure (InternetIdentityProvider, useInternetIdentity, useActor, react-query integration) despite authentication being a stated non-goal and unnecessary for a client-only animation.",
      "reason": "Non-goals include user accounts/authentication and no backend dependency for the animation; diff adds multiple auth/actor-related hooks and wraps the app with an Internet Identity provider and QueryClientProvider.",
